                        <p>Heather Drattlo is an aspiring web developer hailing from Huntsville, AL. After getting out of the
                            US Army Reserves, she has spent the last 10 years working various terrible jobs (and a few good
                            ones) . Heather obtained a Bachelors of Science in Interior design during the great recession
                            from a school that is soon to close due to being morally bankrupt and scamming vast amounts people.
                            Needless to say, nothing much came of that degree.</p>

                        <p>After a series of terrible jobs, Heather has spent 6 years in adult education. She has taught classes
                            in AutoCAD drafting, 3D modeling, and sustainable design. Most recently, she taught computer
                            education courses to inmates in Colorado and Arizona. Heather has done work to develop multiple
                            programs within the prison system to help with inmate rehabilitation and recidivism.</p>

                        <p>Heather is a musician, photographer, and artist. She is always looking for new ways to create and
                            innovate.</p>
